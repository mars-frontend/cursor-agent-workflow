# Analyze Nutrition Weekly Task

Review your nutritional intake patterns from the past week and identify trends, wins, and areas for improvement.

## Weekly Review Process

### Summary Collection

[[LLM: Compile the week's food logs and calculate overall nutritional metrics.]]

1. **Gather Week's Data**
   - Review all 7 days of logs
   - Verify entry completeness
   - Note any missing data
   - Flag unusual patterns

2. **Calculate Aggregate Metrics**
   - Total calories consumed
   - Average daily intake
   - Macronutrient totals (protein, carbs, fats)
   - Key micronutrients tracked
   - Hydration levels

### Pattern Analysis

[[LLM: Identify eating patterns, trends, and behaviors from the weekly data.]]

1. **Consistency Review**
   - Daily calorie variance
   - Meal timing patterns
   - Portion consistency
   - Meal frequency analysis

2. **Nutritional Balance**
   - Macro distribution vs. targets
   - Food group diversity
   - Micronutrient coverage
   - Sugar and sodium intake

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Meal timing consistency
   - Snacking frequency
   - Weekend vs. weekday differences
   - Eating triggers or patterns

### Goal Progress Assessment

[[LLM: Evaluate progress toward stated nutritional and health goals.]]

1. **Against Targets**
   - Caloric goal tracking (within 5% acceptable)
   - Protein target achievement
   - Micronutrient adequacy
   - Hydration goal met

2. **Trend Direction**
   - Week-over-week comparison
   - Progress toward longer goals
   - Habit formation indicators
   - Consistency trending

### Identifying Wins and Challenges

1. **Success Highlights**
   - Meals that hit targets
   - New healthy recipes tried
   - Goal achievements
   - Consistent habits

2. **Challenge Areas**
   - Days that exceeded targets
   - Nutrient gaps
   - Portion control issues
   - Time pressure situations

## Insights Report Format

[[LLM: Present findings in clear, actionable format.]]

### Weekly Dashboard
