# Review Health Trends Task

Conduct a monthly deep-dive analysis of your nutritional patterns and their correlation with health outcomes and wellness goals.

## Monthly Review Framework

### Data Aggregation

[[LLM: Compile and organize a full month of nutritional tracking data for trend analysis.]]

1. **Gather Month's Data**
   - All daily food logs (30 days)
   - Weekly analysis summaries
   - Health metrics if tracked (weight, energy, sleep)
   - Notable events or changes
   - Challenges and successes

2. **Data Quality Check**
   - Verify complete weeks
   - Flag missed or incomplete days
   - Note unusual patterns
   - Identify data entry errors

### Nutritional Trend Analysis

[[LLM: Identify significant patterns, trends, and changes in nutritional intake over the month.]]

1. **Caloric Trends**
   - Average daily intake
   - Variance from target
   - Weekly progression
   - High and low days
   - Trend direction (up/down/stable)

2. **Macronutrient Evolution**
   - Protein consistency
   - Carbohydrate patterns
   - Fat balance
   - Ratio stability
   - Week-to-week changes

3. **Micronutrient Patterns**
   - Key vitamins (D, B12, etc.)
   - Mineral intake (iron, calcium, potassium)
   - Antioxidant sources
   - Micronutrient gaps
   - Supplementation needs

4. **Eating Behavior Patterns**
   - Meal frequency trends
   - Timing consistency
   - Snacking evolution
   - Hydration patterns
   - Weekend vs. weekday differences

### Health Correlation Analysis

[[LLM: Examine relationships between nutritional intake and reported health outcomes.]]

1. **Energy & Performance**
   - Caloric adequacy correlation
   - Carb timing and energy
   - Protein timing and recovery
   - Timing of energy dips

2. **Sleep Quality**
   - Evening meal timing impact
   - Caffeine consumption patterns
   - Pre-sleep eating effects
   - Hydration and sleep

3. **Mood & Mental Health**
   - Sugar intake and mood stability
   - Omega-3 consumption
   - Processed food correlation
   - Meal timing and mood
   - Hydration and focus

4. **Physical Health**
   - Weight change correlation
   - Digestion patterns
   - Inflammation-related foods
   - Bloating triggers
   - Skin health correlation

### Goal Achievement Review

[[LLM: Assess progress toward stated nutritional and health goals.]]

1. **Primary Goal Tracking**
   - Original goal statement
   - Progress to date
   - Pace to completion
   - Barriers encountered
   - Adjustments made

2. **Secondary Metrics**
   - Other health improvements
   - Unexpected positive changes
   - Emerging new goals
   - Capability expansion

3. **Habit Formation**
   - New habits established
   - Consistency scores
   - Automation level
   - Maintenance challenges

## Insights Report

### Monthly Dashboard
```
Key Statistics:
- Average daily calories: X (Variance: ±Y%)
- Protein average: Xg/day (Target: Yg)
- Hydration: X cups/day (Target: Y cups)
- Goal adherence: X% (Excellent/Good/Fair)

Trends:
- Caloric trend: [↑ Increasing / ↓ Decreasing / → Stable]
- Consistency: [Excellent / Good / Variable]
- Energy levels: [Improved / Stable / Declined]
```

### Key Findings
1. Most significant positive changes
2. Challenges or concerns
3. Correlation discoveries
4. Habit strength assessment

### Pattern Recognition
- Recurring weekly patterns
- Situational triggers
- Environmental influences
- Seasonal variations

## Actionable Insights

[[LLM: Provide specific, prioritized recommendations based on analysis.]]

### Top 3 Priorities for Next Month
1. [Specific area] - [Why important] - [How to address]
2. [Specific area] - [Why important] - [How to address]
3. [Specific area] - [Why important] - [How to address]

### Suggested Adjustments
- Nutritional target tweaks
- Timing recommendations
- Food substitutions
- Behavior modifications

### Experiment Opportunities
- New dietary approaches to test
- Supplement considerations
- Meal timing experiments
- Food sensitivities to explore

## Comparative Analysis

- Month-over-month comparison (if applicable)

- Seasonal pattern identification
- Long-term trajectory assessment

## Next Month Planning

1. **Goal Refresh**
   - Refine nutritional targets
   - Set new focus areas
   - Adjust for seasonal changes
   - Plan for known events

2. **Strategy Adjustments**
   - Modified meal plan approach
   - New recipes to try
   - Habit optimization
   - Support system improvements

3. **Tracking Enhancements**
