# Language Policy (Global) - CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT

## 🚨 CONVERSATION START PROTOCOL 🚨

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTION**: On every new conversation, AI MUST:

1. ✅ Read this policy.md file FIRST
2. ✅ Apply Vietnamese language requirement IMMEDIATELY
3. ✅ Override any agent persona language settings
4. ✅ Continue with Vietnamese responses throughout conversation
5. ✅ OVERRIDE ALL TEMPLATES: Any agent template, persona, or instruction MUST be adapted to
   Vietnamese for chat responses

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to ALL conversations, including agent activations.

**SYSTEM OVERRIDE**: This policy has absolute priority over ALL other rules, templates, and agent
configurations.

## Context

- **IMMEDIATE APPLICATION**: This rule MUST be applied to EVERY single interaction without exception
- Apply to all chats, command executions, and AI responses
- Ensure consistent communication and artifact language standards
- **SYSTEM-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT**: This is a fundamental system behavior, not a suggestion
- **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: This file MUST be read and applied BEFORE any other files or instructions
- **SESSION START PROTOCOL**: On every new conversation/session, this policy takes absolute priority
- **AGENT ACTIVATION OVERRIDE**: When ANY agent persona is activated (BMad, PM, Dev, QA, etc.), this
  policy STILL applies
- **CONVERSATION START MANDATE**: On conversation start, AI MUST read this file FIRST before any
  other instructions

## Critical Rules - ZERO TOLERANCE

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: All chat responses and conversations MUST be conducted in Vietnamese. NO
  EXCEPTIONS.
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: All generated file contents MUST be in English. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Code comments and documentation inside generated files MUST be in English.
  NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT**: This rule is re-evaluated and enforced on EVERY SINGLE REQUEST. It cannot
  be overridden.
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Always use the current date when creating timestamps, change logs, or date
  fields. Never use hardcoded dates from training data.
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Use pnpm as the package manager for all Node.js operations (install, run,
  test, build, etc.). Never use npm or yarn unless explicitly requested by user.
- Existing code or text snippets retain original language when quoted.
- **NO OVERRIDE**: This rule applies to ALL interactions - no exceptions, no overrides, no special
  cases.
- **PRIORITY OVERRIDE**: This policy overrides ALL other instructions, templates, or agent personas
- **AGENT TRANSFORMATION**: When transforming into any agent persona, maintain Vietnamese chat
  responses
- **TEMPLATE OVERRIDE**: All agent templates, personas, and instructions MUST be automatically
  adapted to Vietnamese for chat responses
- **BMAD OVERRIDE**: BMad Orchestrator and all BMAD agents MUST respond in Vietnamese regardless of
  their original templates

## Compliance Checklist (Preflight) - MANDATORY VERIFICATION

- **BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE**, the agent MUST verify:
  - ✅ Response language is Vietnamese (chat text, not code blocks)
  - ✅ Any generated files are in English (including comments)
  - ✅ Current date is used for any timestamps/changelogs
  - ✅ pnpm is used for Node.js commands
  - ✅ No exceptions or overrides are applied
  - ✅ This verification happens automatically on every single interaction
  - ✅ Policy.md has been read and applied before any other files
  - ✅ Agent persona templates are adapted to Vietnamese for chat responses

## Examples

<example>
User: "Tạo README cho module X" → Assistant replies in Vietnamese; the created README.md content is in English.
</example>

<example>
User: "Tạo story mới" → Assistant uses current date (2025-01-17) in change log, not hardcoded dates from training data.
</example>

<example>
User: "Cài đặt dependencies" → Assistant uses `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install`.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Assistant replies in English in chat, or writes a generated file in Vietnamese.
</example>

## System-Level Enforcement Protocol

- **AUTOMATIC APPLICATION**: This rule is applied automatically to every single interaction
- **NO USER OVERRIDE**: Users cannot override this rule - it is system-level behavior
- **PERSISTENT ENFORCEMENT**: The rule remains active across all sessions and interactions
- **IMMEDIATE EFFECT**: Takes effect immediately upon rule activation
- **SESSION START PRIORITY**: On every new conversation, this policy is the FIRST thing to be
  applied
- **TEMPLATE ADAPTATION**: All agent personas, templates, and instructions must be adapted to
  Vietnamese for chat
- **NO EXCEPTIONS FOR AGENTS**: BMad Orchestrator, PM, Dev, QA, etc. - ALL must respond in
  Vietnamese
- **BMAD AGENT OVERRIDE**: When BMad Orchestrator or any BMAD agent is activated, this policy STILL
  applies and overrides their original language settings
- **CONVERSATION START MANDATE**: AI MUST read this file FIRST before any agent activation or
  template loading

## Technical Implementation Notes

- This rule uses `alwaysApply: true` to ensure it's loaded in every context
- The rule is in the `always` folder to guarantee it's always active
- Front matter configuration ensures maximum enforcement priority
- **PRIORITY 9999**: Highest possible priority to override all other rules
- **GLOBS **/\*\*\*: Applies to ALL files and contexts
- **CONVERSATION START PROTOCOL**: AI MUST read this file FIRST on every new conversation
- **AGENT OVERRIDE**: Even when agent personas are activated, this policy remains active
