# Hidden Folders Awareness (Always)

## Context

- Apply in every chat and request
- Ensure agents are aware of hidden project folders and where to find their summaries

## Critical Rules

- **MANDATORY**: On every request, before any reasoning, the agent MUST check all BMAD folders
  (hidden and non-hidden) at repo root to ensure awareness of latest assets/configs. This includes
  `.bmad-*` folders, any `bmad*` directories, `.claude/`, and `.cursor/rules/bmad/`.
- On each request, assume the presence of the following folders at repo root:
  - `.bmad-core/` - Core BMAD system with agents, tasks, templates, workflows
  - `.claude/` - Claude commands and agent definitions
  - `.cursor/` - Cursor IDE rules and configurations
  - `.ai/` - AI-related files and codebase statistics
- For BMAD configuration, prefer `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
- For role rulepacks, prefer `.cursor/rules/bmad/`
- For global chat behavior, load `.cursor/rules/always/`

## BMAD Bundle Structure Details

### Core BMAD System (`.bmad-core/`)

- **agents/**: Core agents (analyst, architect, dev, pm, po, qa, sm, ux-expert, bmad-master,
  bmad-orchestrator)
- **tasks/**: Core tasks for project management, story creation, documentation
- **templates/**: Templates for PRD, architecture, stories, QA gates
- **workflows/**: Brownfield and greenfield workflows for fullstack, service, UI
- **checklists/**: Quality checklists for various roles and processes
- **data/**: Knowledge base, elicitation methods, technical preferences

### Specialized Bundles

- **`.bmad-food-drink-tracker/`**: Food and drink tracker

### Supporting Directories

- **`.claude/commands/`**: Claude command definitions organized by bundle
- **`.ai/`**: Codebase statistics and AI-related metadata

## Examples

<example>
Agent needs to reference BMAD tasks → checks `.bmad-core/tasks/` and confirms via `memory-bank/inventory.md`.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Agent assumes folders don't exist and fails to consult `memory-bank/inventory.md`.
</example>
