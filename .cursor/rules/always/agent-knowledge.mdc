# Agent Thinking & Post-Request Feedback (Always)

## Context

- Ensure careful, reflective reasoning on every request
- Enforce automatic interactive feedback run after each request

## Critical Rules

- Before responding, the agent MUST think carefully and reason step-by-step to ensure correctness
  and completeness.
- Before sending any response, the agent MUST perform a "Policy Compliance Check" against
  `.cursor/rules/always/00-policy.mdc` Compliance Checklist and adjust the draft to comply.
- **CRITICAL**: The Policy Compliance Check MUST verify Vietnamese language requirement is met for
  all chat responses.
- After completing each user request, the agent MUST run MCP Interactive Feedback for the project.
- The feedback run MUST include a short, one-line summary of the changes or outcomes.
- Do not skip or batch feedback runs across multiple requests.

## Examples

<example>
Agent answers a feature question with a concise but well-reasoned response, then triggers MCP Interactive Feedback with summary: "Updated rules to enforce VN chat + EN files and post-request feedback."
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Agent responds quickly without deliberate reasoning, and does not run MCP Interactive Feedback after the answer.
</example>
