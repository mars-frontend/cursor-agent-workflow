# Load Order Control - CRITICAL SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

## Context

- This file ensures critical policies are loaded in the correct order
- Must be loaded BEFORE any other rules to establish proper precedence
- Uses highest possible priority to override all other configurations

## Critical Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Policy file `.cursor/rules/always/00-policy.mdc` MUST be loaded FIRST
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Always rules MUST be loaded before core rules
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: Core rules MUST be loaded before domain-specific rules
- **ABSOLUTE MANDATORY**: BMad rules are loaded only when needed
- **SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT**: This load order cannot be overridden by any other configuration

## Load Order Priority

1. **FIRST**: `.cursor/rules/always/00-policy.mdc` (Language Policy)
2. **SECOND**: `.cursor/rules/always/agent-knowledge.mdc` (Agent Behavior)
3. **THIRD**: `.cursor/rules/always/awareness.mdc` (Folder Awareness)
7. **LAST**: `.cursor/rules/bmad/**` (BMad Rules - when needed)

## Examples

<example>
System loads 00-policy.mdc first, ensuring Vietnamese language requirement is applied before any other rules.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
System loads technical rules before policy rules, causing language policy to be overridden.
</example>
