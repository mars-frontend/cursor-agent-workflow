# FRONTEND RULES

## Framework Discipline
- Respect existing patterns (no mixing styles)
- Vue: Options API / Composition API consistency
- React: Hooks / Class component consistency
- Preserve component hierarchy

## Rendering & Hydration
- NEVER introduce hydration mismatches
- Preserve SSR/CSR semantics
- Client-only code must be explicit
- No unsafe `useEffect` / `onMounted` assumptions

## State Management
- Follow existing state strategy
- No implicit reactivity coupling
- Async state must be traceable
- No hidden side effects in computed/derived state

## TypeScript
- Do NOT loosen types to fix errors
- Prefer explicit types at boundaries
- Never use `any` unless already present
- Generic types must have constraints

## Performance
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy load heavy components
- Code split by route/feature
- Preserve existing bundle size

## Accessibility
- Maintain ARIA attributes
- Preserve keyboard navigation
- No semantic HTML degradation
