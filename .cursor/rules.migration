# MIGRATION RULES

## Strategy
- Incremental ONLY (no big-bang rewrites)
- Old and new code MUST coexist
- Feature parity is mandatory
- Backward compatibility required

## Change Control
- One module at a time
- No opportunistic refactors
- Preserve public contracts
- Version compatibility matrix

## Rollback Safety
Every step must be:
✓ Independently reversible
✓ Non-destructive
✓ Feature-flaggable (if possible)

## Stop Conditions
STOP if:
- Behavior divergence detected
- Hidden coupling emerges
- Performance regression >10%
- Test coverage drops

## Documentation
Required for each migration step:
- Before/after comparison
- Rollback procedure
- Known limitations
- Follow-up tasks
