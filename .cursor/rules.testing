# TESTING RULES

## Test Preservation
- NEVER delete tests without approval
- Maintain or improve coverage
- Prefer extending over rewriting

## Test Quality
- Tests must be deterministic
- No flaky tests
- No test interdependencies
- Fast execution (<5s per suite)

## Coverage Requirements
- New code: 80% coverage minimum
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Edge cases documented

## Test Types
Unit tests:
- Pure function logic
- Component behavior
- Utility functions

Integration tests:
- API contracts
- Database interactions
- External service mocks

E2E tests:
- Critical user flows
- Only for high-value scenarios
