# Product Context: Company Management System

## Why This Project Exists
Administrators need a centralized, efficient way to manage company data across the system. Manual processes and scattered data sources create inefficiencies, errors, and poor user experience.

## Problems It Solves
- **Data Fragmentation**: Consolidates company information in one place
- **Manual Processes**: Automates company management workflows
- **Access Control**: Provides secure, role-based access to company data
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures uniform company information across the system
- **Scalability**: Handles growing company databases efficiently

## How It Should Work
1. **Authentication**: Secure admin login with role verification
2. **Company Listing**: Paginated table with search, sort, and filter capabilities
3. **Company Details**: Comprehensive view of all company information
4. **Company Management**: Create, edit, and update company records
5. **Status Management**: Toggle company active/inactive status
6. **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple companies

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Administrators can navigate without training
- **Fast**: Sub-2 second page loads and responsive interactions
