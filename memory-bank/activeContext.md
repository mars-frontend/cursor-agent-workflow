# Active Context: Company Management System

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization** - Setting up foundational documentation structure for the Next.js company management application.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
- Analyzed existing project structure and TDD documents
- Identified Next.js 15 + App Router architecture
- Documented company management feature requirements

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Create progress.md to track implementation status
   - Review existing TDD documents for completeness
   - Identify any missing technical specifications

2. **Project Analysis**:
   - Review existing codebase for implementation status
   - Compare current state against TDD requirements
   - Identify gaps between design and implementation

3. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Prioritize features based on TDD specifications
   - Create task breakdown for development phases
   - Set up development environment and tooling

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Architecture**: Confirmed Next.js 15 App Router approach
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 for utility-first approach
- **State Management**: Local state with React hooks, considering TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation (to be implemented)

## Current Status
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Established Next.js 15 foundation
- **Documentation**: ✅ TDD documents exist for companies listing and details
- **Implementation**: 🔄 Memory Bank setup in progress
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Core packages installed and configured
- **Configuration**: ✅ Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint configured

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete Memory Bank documentation
2. Review existing TDD completeness
3. Assess current implementation status
4. Plan next development phase

## Open Questions
- What is the current implementation status of the companies features?
- Are there any missing dependencies for the planned features?
- What is the priority order for feature implementation?
- Are there any technical constraints not covered in the TDD?
